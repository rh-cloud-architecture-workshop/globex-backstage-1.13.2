## This is NOT the official Backstage repo (as you might have guessed from the repo hierarchy, just saying...)

This repo is a snapshot of the 1.13.2 version, used for development and debugging/tracing.

==**Tip**== (learned the hard way :weary:, so here to share) - if you are developing more than a boilerplate Backstage for your own needs, fork the [Backstage Repo](https://github.com/backstage/backstage) or, as we did, take a [release version](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases) and build from there.

If you have created your backstage app using `npx @backstage/create-app` the corresponding minified dirty code will be present in your repository somewhere under `node_modules/@backstage/<module>/dist/cjs/<somethingsomething>-xxxx.cjs.js` and it is alomst impossible to debug/trace/inspect (or read) this.
